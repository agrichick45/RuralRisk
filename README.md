# Rural Risk Project

As part of a summer internship with the Environmental Defense Fund, I did a project to quantify Rural Risk in the the Mississippi and Ohio River basin (with 12 different states represented. This project was a huge data compilation with many different socio-economic, cultural and environmental risk factors surrounding environmental and climate justice.

Outputs of this Project include: 
[Agricultural Diversity](AgDiver.html)
[America's Dark Underbelly](DarkRisk.html)
