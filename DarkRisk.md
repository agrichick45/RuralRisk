## Introduction

There are a lot of images, pictures, and stereotypes that pop up when
the notion of “rural America” gets brought up in conversation. This is
especially true around election time. In the wake of the 2016 election,
several monolithic pictures went out portraying the rural communities as
“uneducated, anti-intellectual, hick bumpkins, clinging to God and guns
over the lives and cultures of their fellow Americans.” This was paired
by peoples complete and total surprise on Hilary Clinton’s loss. How did
we miss it?, followed by deep narratives on the “East Coast Elite” and
“Ivory Towers” being out of touch with the real economic problems of
REAL AMERICA.

But this isn’t just about an election. That is a vast oversimplication
of a problem that is much more insidious, wide spread, and dangerous
than most people realize.

This risk is one of the biggest threats to our country, and the world
around us, and it woven into the complex social and cultural dynamics
that make up the region. These issues extend beyond economic security
and simple population loss, and pull into the very psyche, and create
conditions right for fundamentalism and extreme nationalism: the True
Believers.

This section documents the cross sections of America, rural identity,
toxic culutral beliefs, and the cycles of despair and multigenerational
trauma that left open a vacuum that needed to be filled by a savior, and
what precipitated this fall.

## What is the True Believer?

In 1951, American Social Philosopher Eric Hoffer wrote the book “[The
True Believer: : Thoughts on the Nature of Mass
Movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_True_Believer). This book
touched on the reasons why mass movements get started, and how they grip
people, pulling at our deepset psychological needs, creating a call for
action. There are several main sections of this book, but this research
on the American Mississippi and Ohio River Basins are focusing on three
major points:  
- The New Poor  
- Frustration  
- Passionate Hatred

## The New Poor

> The “New Poor” are a different group of people than the extremely
> poor. They are anyone in society that used to be doing well, but now
> are relatively worse off. The New Poor are the most likely group to
> join mass movements.

This section deeps into a deep nostalgia for the times that life really
was better. Even for those that have not fallen yet, there is a distinct
fear that their jobs are next, their security will disappear follow.
This section looks at:  
- Industry Specific Employment Trends, including farming.  
- Debt to asset ratios (farming and personal)  
- Income and Poverty  
- Loss of Farms, and Agricultural Diversity

## Frustration

> A “true believer” who becomes part of a mass movement feels
> frustrated, forgotten and individually powerless. When people feel
> powerless and frustrated, the freedom they deeply ache for is a
> freedom FROM individual responsibility.

### Population Losses and Loss of Representation

!!!!!add map for long term population loss HERE

People cling to their rural roots, even if they no longer are there.
Politicians never did a good job listening to rural constituents, and as
urban areas continue to grow in population, representation is removed
from remote communities.

> Republican state legislatures will try to draw districts that preserve
> the political power of most rural voters, but that task will become
> increasingly difficult as the population balance shifts toward cities.

This loss of voice is real, and feels very profound, and as farm fields
are gobbled up by urban areas, the loss of roots and rural connection
creates a sense of nostalgia, as well as fear of losing the world as
they know it, creates frustration that can be capitalized on.

### Rural Identity and Independence

We… don’t need farmers anymore. Does rural America even really need to
exist?

Like manufacturing, increasing efficiency and mechanization, as well as
corporate consolidation, has reduced the needs of people to even exist
in a lot of these areas.

Wisconsin ALONE lost 2,515 dairy farms from 2017-2021.

People are leaving for centers where jobs are, leaving behind those that
are too old, too poor, or too stagnant to deal with change. And those
that are left behind, are increasingly isolated, and frustrated.

### Toxic Cultural Traits

Internal reflection IS HARD. It is much easier to blame failures on
anything, or everything else. It is a way that people preserve their
self-respect and health, especially when things have not been going
well. It is the fault of: the economy, “the system,” the government,
capitalism, high taxes… anything outside themselves.

These are hard conversations that feed back into rural culture. People
are not just leaving because there is a decreasing need for manual
labor, but they are leaving because they want to get out.

Rural communities are close knit communities that relied on cohesion or
death. When you are focused on surviving, satisfaction is gained from a
full belly from a full days work. Once relative wealth increased, our
interactions as communities and families needed to change and adjust.
But, a lot of times it didn’t.

A lot of these long term family dynamics are elements of ourselves that
can be downright toxic. And unless we are in good contact with
ourselves, we are not even aware we have, and that makes them difficult
to talk about.

## Passionate Hatred

> Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in a God, but never
> without belief in a devil.

Movements need a scapegoat to redirect hate and blame to compensate for
their own personal failures. All failures of the movement to accomplish
their goals can also be blamed on the enemy. In the case of nationalism,
the enemy rotates and depends on who is talking (liberals, anyone who
deviates from “historic normal”, immigrants, etc.)

This section is probably the most frightening, and deals with the
crumbling journalism sector, and how this rapid shift led to the
cultivation of the echo chambers.

Topics Include:  
- Rural School Closures  
- Mass Media Consolidation and the Loss of Newspapers  
- The rise of right wing local news

## Conclusions

When you tie all of these threads together, you wind up with a newly
poor, frustrated group of agitators, brimming with energy and passion to
make a difference in their world. This True Believer style energy was in
need of a voice, and then a man came along who heard them, and
understood their frustration and anger.
